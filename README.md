# Daily Vibe Dose App

A motivational content delivery app that shares daily affirmations and uplifting messages to help users start their day on a positive note.

## Why This Project

## What It Solves
- Delivers rotating daily motivational content
- Encourages a positive mindset and consistent engagement
- Built for simplicity, scalability, and social sharing

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Flask

- HTML/CSS

## Still in Progress
This is an early version. I'm actively improving the design and exploring new features as I continue growing in backend development.
